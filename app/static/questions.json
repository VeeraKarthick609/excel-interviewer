Correctness: Does it correctly use an IF statement to check if the Department (C2) is 'Sales'? 2. Calculation: Does it correctly calculate 5% of the Salary (D2) for the true case and return 0 for the false case? 3. Best Practices: Does it use cell references (e.g., C2, D2) instead of hardcoded values?"
